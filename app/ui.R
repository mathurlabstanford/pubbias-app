        These analyses consider publication bias that favors affirmative studies (i.e., those with positive estimates and significant p-values) over nonaffirmative studies (i.e., those with negative or nonsignificant estimates). These analyses enable statements such as: "For publication bias to shift the observed point estimate to the null, significant results would need to be at least 30-fold more likely to be published than negative or nonsignificant results." Alternatively, you can consider shifting to a chosen non-null value or shifting the confidence interval to include the null or another value.
        
        \n\nThis website also provides a worst-case meta-analytic point estimate under maximal publication bias obtained simply by conducting a standard meta-analysis of only the negative and nonsignificant studies.'
